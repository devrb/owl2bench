# OWL2Bench Documentation
This document provides documentation for the first version of our benchmark OWL2Bench (Accepted at ISWC'20 Resources Track). OWL2Bench can be used to benchmark three aspects of the reasoners - support for OWL 2 language constructs, scalability in terms of ABox size, and the query performance.

## 1. Introduction
OWl 2 is gaining popularity in a variety of domains because of its high level of expressivity. OWL 2 has several profiles such as OWL 2 EL, OWl 2 QL, OWL 2 RL, and OWL 2 DL that vary in terms of their expressivity and reasoning performance. There are several OWL 2 reasoners (such as Hermit, JFact, Openllet, Pellet, Konclude and ELK) and some SPARQL query engines (such as Stardog and GraphDB) that are backed by OWL 2 Reasoners so as to help answer queries that involve reasoning. Our benchmark, OWL2Bench, is an extension of well known University Ontology Benchmark (UOBM). OWL2Bench includes fixed TBox for each profile covering the set of constructs supported by that profile, generation of ABox of varying sizes and a separate set of SPARQL queries for each profile to be executed over generated data for performance evaluation of several reasoners and SPARQL query engines.

The hierarchy among some of the classes, including the relations between them, is shown in the figure below. All the four TBoxes (one for each profile) of OWL2Bench consist of classes such as University, College, CollegeDiscipline, Department, Person, Program, and Course. They are related to each other through relationships such as enrollFor, teachesCourse, and offerCourse. The labeled (dashed) edges represent the properties. The unlabeled edges represent the subclass relation.

## 1.1 TBox Details 

The OWL2Bench TBoxes have been built by enriching the existing UOBM ontology with the supported OWL 2 constructs in each profile. Each TBox follows the syntactic restritions of the particular profile.

OWL 2 DL : UNIV-BENCH-OWL2DL.owl

OWL 2 RL : UNIV-BENCH-OWL2RL.owl

OWL 2 QL : UNIV-BENCH-OWL2QL.owl

OWL 2 EL : UNIV-BENCH-OWL2EL.owl

## 1.2 ABox Details 

ABox axioms are generated by OWL2Bench based on two user inputs, the number of universities and the OWL 2 profile (EL, QL, RL, DL) of interest. The
instance data that is generated complies with the schema defined in the TBox of the selected profile. The size of the instance data depends on the number of universities. The axioms generated from the code are the assertion axioms (class, object property and data property). First of all, the instances (class assertion axioms) for the University class are generated and their number is equal to the number of universities specified by the user. Then for each University class instance, instances for College, Research Group and Publication are generated. For each College, Department instances are generated. For each Department, instances of Man, Woman, Program, and Course are generated. The number of instances that are generated for each class is selected automatically and randomly from the range specified in the configuration file. The other Classes are defined (in the TBox) in such a way that the reasoner can draw inferences for them. For example, a Person class is a union of Man and Woman classes. 

Property assertion axioms are created using these instances. For example, an object property isDepartmentOf links a Department instance to a College instance. Similarly, a data property hasName is used to connect a department name to a Department instance. The number of instances of each class (other than University) and the number of connections between all the instances are again selected automatically and randomly from the range specified in the configuration file.

## 1.3 SPARQL Query Details

OWL2Bench consists of twenty-two SPARQL queries to test the query performance of the OWL 2 reasoners. The SPARQL Queries are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3838735

## 2. About the Repository
The project repository consists of 2 main directories: **[OWL2Bench](https://github.com/kracr/owl2bench/tree/master/OWL2Bench)** and **[Experiments](https://github.com/kracr/owl2bench/tree/master/Experiments)**.

**OWL2Bench** is a java source code directory that generates the varying size datasets (TBox + ABox) to compare the reasoning and querying performance of OWL 2 Reasoners (see section [ 6.2 ](#code) for source-code usage instructions). 

**Experiments** directory consists of details about the experiments that were reported in our paper accepted at ISWC'20 Resources Track. 

The repository also consists of four different **TBox** for each OWL 2 Profiles (EL, QL, RL and DL): **UNIV-BENCH-OWL2EL.owl**, **UNIV-BENCH-OWL2QL.owl**, **UNIV-BENCH-OWL2RL.owl**, **UNIV-BENCH-OWL2DL.owl**, and a java executable jar file : **[OWL2Bench.jar](https://github.com/kracr/owl2bench/blob/master/OWL2Bench.jar)**.


<a name="usage"></a>
## 3. Usage Instructions

The user must have java and maven installed in the system. The user needs to provide two inputs, the number of universities and the OWL 2 profile (EL, QL, RL, DL) of interest. The ABox axioms are generated using OWL2Bench code, complying with the schema defined in the TBox of the selected profile. The size of the ABox depends on the number of universities. The final dataset on which the reasoners are evaluated consists of both TBox and ABox axioms.

<a name="exe"></a>
## 3.1. Direct execution using executable jar :

We have provided a java executable jar **OWL2Bench.jar** that generates the datasets using the default configurations (that were used in the experiments). In order to execute this Jar file, user need to give the inputs (in the same order): **Number of Universities** (mandatory), **Required OWL 2 Profile** (mandatory), and Seed (optional). 

For eg. : 

java -jar OWL2Bench.jar 10 EL 20 (where 10 is the number of universities,  EL is OWL 2 profile and 20 is the seed value)

java -jar OWL2Bench.jar 1 DL (where 1 is the number of universities,  DL is OWL 2 profile and the default seed value)
         
Number of universities makes the ABox scalable. By default, the number of ABox axioms for 1 university is approximately 50,000 that reaches upto 14,000,000 for 200 universities.      
To execute **OWL2Bench.jar**, make sure the TBox for all profiles (UNIV-BENCH-OWL2EL.owl, UNIV-BENCH-OWL2QL.owl, UNIV-BENCH-OWL2RL.owl, UNIV-BENCH-OWL2DL.owl) and excel file for random names RandomNames.xlsx is present in the same directory as jar file. RandomNames.xlsx is used to generate real like names for University and Person instances.


<a name="code"></a>
## 3.2. Using Source Code :

We are also providing the java source code for ABox generation. User can download the project repository OWL2Bench. Extract it and save it in a folder. Open command line and change to the directory that contains the pom.xml of the project. Execute the maven command:

mvn compile

mvn install

Now, using maven's exec plugin, run the main class *Generator* and pass the list of arguments *Number of Universities, Required OWL 2 Profile and Seed* (same as above) using exec.args. For example-

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=ABoxGen.InstanceGenerator.Generator -Dexec.args="1 QL 1" , or 

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=ABoxGen.InstanceGenerator.Generator -Dexec.args="1 QL"

The output files are stored in files with names such as "OWL2"+ Profile + "-" + Number of Universities + ".owl" . For example. OWL2DL-1.owl, OWL2QL-1.owl, OWL2EL-10.owl, OWL2RL-100.owl. 

**Note:** 

Since we are providing the seed value as one of the inputs to the ABox generation algorithm along with the number of Universities and the desired OWL2 profile, the same set of instances is generated if the seed value remains the same across multiple runs. If the user does not specify the seed value then the default seed value of 1 will be used. Similar principle was used in UOBM as well.

In order to change the default size of the generated ABox as well as to control the density of each node (number of connections between different instances), the range (maximum and minimum values of the parameters) can be modified in the configuration file. Moreover, the output ontology format can also be specified in the configuration file (owx for OWL_XML, ofn for OWL_Functional, omn for OWL_Manchester, ttl for Turtle, rdf for RDF_XML). By default, the generated ontology format is RDF/XML.

## 4. Future Work

For the next version of OWL2Bench, we plan to be able to customize the TBox for each profile rather than having a fixed TBox. We also plan to extend this by providing an option to the users to choose the desired hardness level (easy, medium, and hard) of the ontology with respect to the reasoning time and OWL2Bench will then generate such an ontology.
